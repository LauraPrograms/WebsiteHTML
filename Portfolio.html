    <h2>Portfolio</h2>
    <p>
        You can find most of my code follow me on git hub <a href="https://github.com/LauraPrograms">LauraPrograms</a>.
        My favorite program I have made so far would be the <a href="https://github.com/LauraPrograms/AlgorithmGuesserLab">Algorithm Guesser</a>. I plan on updating the repo with slower algorithms.
        My next goal would be to try to get an algorithm set up based on various chemical reactions and their energies to show the scaling up rate of various reactions and how their outputs change.
