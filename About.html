    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I have recently converted from chemistry into the tech industry. I love how programming simplifies EVERYTHING. The way it can help pull data together and display it, organize it, solve problems, etc.
        In the hours I am not programming, I am working on writing - this means beta reading, researching new techiniques, editing, plotting  - you know what, most of writing 
        is not writing, I probably spend 15% of my time writing the story and the rest trying to fix it. I currently have a one completed book under my belt, a short story collection - working on getting them published.
        When I am not writing, I am training my hyper dog - she really wants to be smart.
        Here is the dog picture tax;

            I am also governed by a mighty cat with a glorious mustache (his claws are digging into my lap as a write this- the little guy is purring too!).

        <p> I current live in the Greater Detroit Area. Before that, I grew up in Albuquerque, New Mexico. No, I have not seen the show Breaking Bad.</p>
